furry-text-search
-----------------

furry-text-search is a library written in TypeScript to handle furry/fuzzy, imprecise, forgiving text search. It is based on [Fuse.js](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse) albeit greatly simplified, and converted to proper TypeScript.

This library is probably not for everyone. I forked it specifically to use [in a project](https://bus-alerts.com/) where I needed a library like Fuse.js, but didn't need all of its features.

If you need more advanced features, there's a good chance you shouldn't be using this library lol
